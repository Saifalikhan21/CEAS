# CEAS: Collective Ethics in Autonomous Traffic (MVP)

> **What it is:** A tiny, **reproducible** evaluation harness for intersection control that reports  
> **Delay Gini (fairness)** and **Emergency On-Time** across **Actuated / FCFS / Max-Pressure** baselines.  
> **One command → one plot + one CSV.**  
> **Next up:** BWS (Bounded-Wait Scheduling) and a SUMO (TraCI) adapter.

  <em>Fairness isn’t a vibe—it’s a metric.</em>

## Why this exists
Most traffic controllers optimize **throughput** and **safety**, but cities also care about **who waits** and **whether emergency vehicles actually get through on time**.  
CEAS turns those values into **measurable outputs** that engineers and policy folks can read in minutes.

## What you get (today)
- **Metrics**: Delay inequality (**Gini**), emergency **on-time rate** (+ bootstrap CIs)
- **Baselines**: **Actuated**, **FCFS**, **Max-Pressure** (proxy)
- **Artifacts**: a single **plot** and a **CSV summary** generated by scripts
- **Reproducible by default**: seeds, environment, scripted runs

## Quickstart (3 commands)
```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate ceas
python -m scripts.run_baselines && python -m scripts.make_plots
